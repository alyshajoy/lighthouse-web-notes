# Responsive Design

* instead of using pixels, we want to use percentages so that they change depending on the size of the screen
  * the percentage you put is the percentage of the container that the element will take up


### Meta Tag

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

This meta tag should be used in every single html project in order for responsive design to work.

### SASS

* SASS on it's own won't load on a page
* can do a lot more with a lot less code
* need to npm install it
