# Week Two Notes

### Higher-Order Functions / Functional Programming

* higher-order functions are ones that take in callbacks
  * in other words, higher order functions are any functions which *operate* on other functions
* this means, built in functions (ie. forEach, filter, etc.) can be higher-order functions

* the use of higher-order functions is a huge part of functional programming
* functional programming leads to less bugs, is easier to reason, and takes less time to create, and you can reuse more code

* **_*functions are values*_**
* when using .filter, it won't modify the original array - you need to assign it to a new variable
* using functional programming allows us to reuse small functions all over our code
  * this allows for less code to be written (and less logic required)
