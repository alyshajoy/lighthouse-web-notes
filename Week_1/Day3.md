# Lecture: The Dev Workflow

### Approach to Lectures

* lectures are over Zoon
* ask questions!
* will always have a break in the middle
* right before break, we'll take attendance
* don't write everything you see - it will be provided after the lecture
  * instead, write down keywords/concepts you want to explore later
* our lectures will be a mix of theory and hands-on
* focus on the approach
  * how an instructor problem solves
  * step-by-step problem breakdown
  * error-driven development

### After a Lecture

* don't expect to understand everything 100%
* look for patterns you can repeat
* repetition is key!
* if you're struggling with a concept, try to find more ways to try it out (ie. online challenges) -> you can even ask an AR for help with these questions that aren't in Compass

### Lectures are Not:

* a time to work on your exercise
* code-along

Use present tense for git commit messages.

Commit every time you solve an error or get something working.

With git, every time we use the word origin, we are just referring to the url to our github repo.
